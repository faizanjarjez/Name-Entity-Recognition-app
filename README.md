Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that identifies and classifies named entities within text, such as names, organizations, locations, and dates. It's a subtask of information extraction, helping machines understand and extract key information from unstructured text. NER is crucial for various applications, including search engines, chatbots, and sentiment analysis.
